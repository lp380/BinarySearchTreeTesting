Things to make sure of if project isn't running

1. Make sure that 'src' folder is marked as root
   - Right click TestingProject/src > 'Mark directory as Root'
2. Need to explicitly create an 'out' folderi
   - mkdir TestingProject/out
   - File > Project Structure > Project
       - Project SDK -> 1.8
       - Project Language Level -> SDK default (8 - Lambdas, type annotations, etc)
       - Project Compiler Output -> TestingProject/out

## Using Maven to Install dependencies

ON MAC:

First we need to install maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html

Then we need to add Maven to PATH variable

run 'mvn -v' to verify that it has installed and been added to your Path correctly


The required dependencies for Mockito, JUnit and Log4J are defined in pom.xml, located at /TestingProject/pom.xml.  Make sure pom.xml is located at the root of 'TestingProject'  In IntelliJ, go to either Build > Build project or Build > Rebuild Project.  

Once Maven downloads the dependencies, they will be located at 'External Libraries' in the Project Explorer.  If they still aren't downloading, right click on the project, go to 'Add framework support...', and check 'Maven' 

Once you click 'Okay', Maven will resolve and download the dependencies.  Whenever you make a chnage to the pom.xml file, a pop up will appear that will say 'Maven projects need to be imported'.  Clicking 'Import Changes' will make Maven download everything.  Alternatively, right click on the project, go down to 'Maven' and click 'Reimport'.  

All of the dependencies should be located under 'External Libraries'
